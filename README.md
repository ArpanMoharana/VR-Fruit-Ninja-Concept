# VR Fruit Ninja - A Work in Progress

A simple proof-of-concept for a fruit-slicing game built in Unity for VR. This is an incomplete project demonstrating the basic mechanics of VR interaction and physics-based object spawning.

## Currently Implemented Features:
* VR controller setup with an attached sword.
* A spawner that launches physics-based objects (fruits).
* Collision detection for slicing objects with the sword.
* Collision detection for missed objects hitting the floor.
* A clean repository setup using a `.gitignore` for Unity.

To run this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ArpanMoharana/VR-Fruit-Ninja-Concept.git](https://github.com/ArpanMoharana/VR-Fruit-Ninja-Concept.git)
    ```
2.  **Open in Unity Hub:**
    * Launch Unity Hub.
    * Click "Open" -> "Add project from disk".
    * Navigate to the cloned `VR-Fruit-Ninja-Concept` folder and select the `VR FRUIT NINJA` sub-folder.
3.  **Run the Scene:**
    * Once the project is open, load the main scene from the `Assets/Scenes` folder.
    * Press the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play button to start the game in the Editor (using the XR Device Simulator).
      
*This project is a foundational concept and requires further development to be a full game.*

## üìù Future Development

This project provides a strong foundation. The next logical steps for development are:

* **Implement 3D Models:** Replace the placeholder fruit objects with the models from the included assets.
* **Add VFX & SFX:** Create particle effects for fruit slices and add satisfying sound effects.
* **Develop a Scoring System:** Implement a `GameManager` to track score, combos, and misses.
* **Create a UI:** Design a user interface to display the score and other game information.
* **Introduce Obstacles:** Add bombs or other objects that the player must avoid.
